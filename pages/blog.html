                <p>It seems like technology has been one of the greatest innovations till now. Well even though it is
                    true to some extent but behind every advancement lies a consideration for potential drawbacks. First
                    and foremost, the major drawback that people are facing is simply due to social isolation. With the
                    excessive use of technological innovations people are being more and more less sociable and relying
                    on technology for everything. This has also led to some people being lazy and fully dependent on it
                    for everything. A negative aspect of technology for people using it not appropriately is that
                    people are addicted to it and waste most part of their time being useless. This can be also termed
                    as digital addiction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In a business world to though the impact of technology lies major in the good
                    side however, it has also raised issues such as cybersecurity threats. This includes hacking,
                    malware, fishing which not only severely harms a business but also impacts all of the stakeholders'
                    raising concerns regarding data privacy. Another rising problem that can be seen in today's world is
                    with the advancement in artificial intelligent and various other technological innovations, people
                    can be prone to job displacement and unemployment. The world would simply be running by machines in
                    the future time if this remains in continuity.

            <p>
                As we can see, technology has both pros and cons to it but what differs its output is simply how a
                person is using those advancements. With a proper utilization of these technological tools people can
                enlighten their daily life into a much safer and a convenient stay. In the field of business technology
                can be used in development of various firms and it really opens the doors of various opportunities if
                used effectively. However, with a careless use and an inappropriate use of technology, we would have to
                face severe consequences which is far beyond our imagination. Technology withholds the power to both
                develop and destroy our lives in a short period of time.
